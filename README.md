#Batman Wiki

##Overview
Users can create an account and sign in. Users can create articles about Batman and will be listed as a contributor on the article page. You can also click on a user and view what articles they have contributed to.

##Approach
I read through the docs on Rails associations and it was pretty straightforward from there. I created an article and users resource. I added a join table with a migration. Lastly, I needed to update the views and paths to show and redirect users to the correct pages.
